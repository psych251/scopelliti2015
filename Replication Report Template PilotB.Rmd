##Introduction

Scopelliti et al., 2015 explored how self-promotion (i.e., communicating one’s positive traits) can lead to contradicting emotional perspectives. The self-promoter may perceive that the recipient feels more positive emotions and less negative emotions about the promoter’s behavior than the recipient’s true emotional reaction. These "failures of emotional perspective taking" can have negative consequences, where recipients may see the self-promoters as bragging. The authors argued that "people tend to underestimate differences between their own and others' emotional reactions" by using their own emotions as "anchors to estimate" their recipient's emotions. They hypothesized that "self-promoters will overestimate the extent to which their behavior elicits positive emotional reactions in others, and underestimate the extent to which their behavior elicits negative emotional reactions."  

##Methods

###Power Analysis

I used G*Power 3.1 to conduct my a priori power analysis to plan the sample size. Specifically, I used a repeated-measures ANOVA for the main within-between (emotion x condition) interaction to plan my sample size since the authors used a 2-way mixed ANOVA, with 2 (between) groups and 7 (within) measurements to calculate their effects. The authors' reported effect size was $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .07, which corresponds to effect size of f = 0.274. I set $\alpha$ = .05. In order to achieve 80% power, the yielded sample size was very small (N=16) either because the authors over-powered their sample number or the analysis yielded a huge effect. Therefore, I set the power to = .95 to increase the proposed sample size. Thus, my determined sample size is 50 to achieve 95% power.

###Procedure	

Participants completed a short survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the self-promotion condition or the recipient-of-self-promotion condition. "Sample size was set to a minimum of 75 participants per condition, and the data were analyzed only after data collection had been completed. 154 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers accessed and completed a short study on personality and received $0.50 as compensation. As in Experiment 1, participants described an instance of having engaged in self-promotion or having been the recipient of someone else's self-promotion. Next, participants in the self-promotion condition were asked to indicate the extent to which their counterpart had felt happy for, proud of, annoyed by, jealous of, angry at, upset by, and inferior to them, whereas participants in the recipient-of-self-promotion condition were asked to rate their own level of these experienced feelings." The between-subjects factor is "reporter" (either self-promoter **or** recipient). The emotions are considered a within-subjects factor only because participants in both conditions rate the same emotions. "All emotions were rated on 7-point scales from *not at all* (1) to *very much* (7)." The replication will instead recruit 25 participants per condition based on the power analysis, and pilot data has been collected and analyzed. My pilot data suggest that the survey takes approximately 4-5 minutes to complete, so participants will receive 60 cents as compensation.

###Analysis Plan

This experiment is a two-cell between-subjects design where participants are randomized to *either* the self-promoter or recipient-of-self-promotion conditions (between-subjects). The authors performed a 2-way mixed ANOVA on ratings of the 7 emotional reactions. The *between-subjects* factor is condition (SP vs. R of SP), and the *within-subjects* factor is emotion. Post-hoc F-tests were performed to examine which emotions were over- or under-estimated. The topics of self-promotion (i.e., the descriptions of bragging) are categorized by 2 research assistants (RAs) only to be included as covariates. The 2 RAs independently categorized the descriptions into predefined categories of (a) achievements; (b) individual traits and skills; (c) money, possessions, power, and status; (d) family and relationships; and (e) luck. These covariates are dummy coded, and "luck serves as the baseline topic." Data will be excluded if participants claimed to have never bragged or if the situation described is not clearly bragging as defined by the coders. Demographic variables of gender and age seem to only be reported as sample descriptives in the original article, so this replication will follow that strategy.

**Key analysis of interest: A 2-way mixed ANOVA on ratings of the 7 emotional reactions, where emotion is the within-subjects factor, and condition is the between-subjects factor.**  If the interaction is significant, I will conduct post-hoc F tests to examine which emotions are over- or under-estimated.

###Differences from Original Study

Differences include planned sample size and possibly the implementation. The paper doesn't specify if the surveys were created on MTurk or through another medium, such as Qualtrics. My implementation will use MTurk to deliver the Qualtrics survey, which may be a slightly different implementation than the original study. I don't anticipate these differences to make a difference based on the large effect from the original study and the materials being presented almost exactly as is described in the original paper.

##Results

The main statistic the authors report is the condition x emotion interaction, *F*(6,912)=10.90, *p*<.001, $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .07. The main aim of the replication is to replicate this interaction. If significant, I will aim to replicate the post-hoc difference in means for each emotion to show that people in the self-promotion condition "overestimated the extent to which recipients felt happy for them (*M*=4.88, *SD*=1.78, vs. *M*=3.70, *SD*=1.91), *F*(1,145)=10.85, *p*=.001, $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .07, and proud of them (*M*=4.33, *SD*=1.81, vs. *M*=3.08, *SD*=1.77), *F*(1,145)=12.12, *p*<.001, $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .08", and also "underestimated the extent to which recipients felt annoyed (*M*=3.54, *SD*=1.94, vs. *M*=4.82, *SD*=2.15), *F*(1,145)=11.56, *p*=.001, $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = .07."

mean_age <- mean(PilotB$Age) # 31
sd_age <- sd(PilotB$Age) # 4.546061

PilotB$Gender <- as.factor(PilotB$Gender)
Nmale <- PilotB[which(PilotB$Gender == '1'), ] # 3
Nfemale <- PilotB[which(PilotB$Gender == '2'), ] # 1 
percent_female <- (1/4)*100 # 25%
percent_male <- (3/4)*100 # 75% 
```
`r Npart` participants (mean age = `r mean_age` years, *SD* = `r sd_age_r`; `r percent_male`% male, `r percent_female`% female) accessed and completed a short study on personality.

#### 2-way mixed ANOVA
```{r}
# With Covariates (The Between-subjects factor was estimated with inclusion of the topic covariates): With this pilot data I'm not including covariates in the between-subjects model due to small N, but I commented out the code that I will run on real data.

print(Cond_aov_sum)

# Cond_aov_sum <- summary(Cond_aov) 
# print(Cond_aov_sum)

# Without Covariates (The Within-subjects factor estimated without inclusion of the topic covariates)

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Saved parameters for the Condition main effect

Cond_Fstat_r <- round(Cond_Fstat, digits = 2) # 0.01
Cond_pval <- Cond_aov_sum[[1]][[1]][[1,"Pr(>F)"]] # 0.9298138

```

As per the authors' analyses, I will estimate the main effect of *Condition* with the inclusion of topic covariates, I will estimate the main effect of *Emotion* without topic covariates, and I will estimate the interaction with the inclusion of topic covariates. With this pilot, there is a main effect of *Emotion*, *F*(`r Emo_num_df`,`r Emo_den_df`) = `r Emo_Fstat_r`, *p* = `r Emo_pval_r` but no main effect of *Condition*, *F*(`r Cond_num_df`,`r Cond_den_df`) = `r Cond_Fstat_r`, *p* = `r Cond_pval_r`, which is consistent with the authors' findings. However, the interaction statistic that I aimed to replicate is not significant, *F*(`r num_df`,`r den_df`) = `r Fstat_r`, *p* = `r pval_r`, $\eta_{p}^{2}$ = `r part_eta_r`. I therefore did not conduct post-hoc tests since the interaction wasn't significant, which will impact the interpretation of any simple effects. I did not include age or gender in my models because the original paper does not do so.

#### Graphing the Results
```{r, include=FALSE}
# Bargraph with SE bars
meanAndSem=function(x) c(mn = mean(x,na.rm=TRUE), se = sd(x,na.rm=T)/sqrt((sum(as.double(!is.na(x))))), len=sum(as.double(!is.na(x))))
require(plyr)
require(reshape)
Fig1 = ddply(PilotB_long, .(Cond,Emo), summarize,mn = meanAndSem(Rating)[1], se = meanAndSem(Rating)[2])
Fig1
Fig1 = ddply(PilotB_long, .(Cond,Emo), summarize, mn = meanAndSem(Rating)[1], se = meanAndSem(Rating)[2])
Fig1
limits = aes(ymax = mn + se, ymin=mn - se)
```

```{r}
Fig1_plot = ggplot(Fig1, aes(x = factor(Emo), y = mn, fill = factor(Cond)))+geom_bar(width=.9, stat = 'identity', position=position_dodge(.95),size=1.5,alpha = 0.7)+labs(title = "Miscalibrated Predictions of Responses to Self-Promotion", y="Extent of Emotion",x="Emotion")+geom_errorbar(limits,color = 'black',position=position_dodge(.95),width=0.25) + labs(color = "Group") + theme(axis.title=element_text(face="bold",size="14", color="black")) + theme(title = element_text(face = "bold")) +  scale_fill_discrete("Group", labels = c("Experienced by Recipient", "Predicted by Self-Promoter"))
print(Fig1_plot)
```

This replication graph shows "self-Promoters' predictions of recipients' experienced emotions and recipients' ratings of their actual experienced emotions. Error bars represent +/-1 SEM." For this replication graph, some of the error bars are huge due to the low N of this pilot. Overall, however, the replicated visualization is difficult to interpret given the low N of this pilot.

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

I wasn't able to fully replicate the authors' findings with this pilot data due to the low N of this pilot. This pilot helped in deciding how to code the statistical tests for actual data collection.

### Commentary

(a) The results with pilot data, which was implemented via MTurk, are difficult to interpret given this pilot data consists of 4 participants and was only intended to test the viability and the code that I will eventually use for actual data collection. 

(b) Although this replication partially failed, the F statistic is in the right direction and with more people, might attain significance.

(c) One thing to note is that I coded the topics of bragging myself instead of having 2 RAs code these topics since this is the pilot. I will be having another student help me code these topics for actual data collection.
